In case I decide to end suffering, all my project files, everything i've done etc. will go here.

This place is designed as a compilation of my legacy, things i've done, and my acheivements. It's also meant as a "digital shrine" to anyone who apriceated my work.

Everything posted here will be released as AGPLv3 to prevent unfair usage. Projects won't be labeled, and stuff will be thrown as-it-is. By the time this repository gets an actual use, I won't have time and energy to segregate and label everything. Sorry.
